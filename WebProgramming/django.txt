> django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME

manage.py file is used to execute commands on the django project 

to run the project
> python manage.py runserver

127.0.0.1 means that it is running on your local computer
8000 is a port number, what type of service is being run
starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Creates an folder with the name APP_NAME where you can add urls to in urls.py and render those pages in views.py
> python manage.py startapp APP_NAME

After making a new app go in settings.py add the app name you made to the INSTALLED_APPS list
settings.py will have the app names and urls.py will have the paths that will appear in the search bar

To create a route in your webapp go to views.py
This renders a html template that displays the given text
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Text")

In the app you need to make a urls.py file that will tell the app when to run what functions
you create a list in urls.py called urlpatterns where you store the path information
path("route", function_path, name="urlpattern_name")

to add a file from current directory
from . import file

finally you add the path to the urls.py file in the main app for the project
include("hello.urls") adds all of the urls that are in hello as well
urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("APP_NAME/", include("APP_NAME.file_name")),
    path("hello/", include("hello.urls"))
]

the main app urls file contains the list of urls that you can access
added the hello application and telling django to look at urls.py in hello directory to see what additional urls you can get to
in the hello app the urls.py file sets the default route to run views.index

abstracts the route and saves it as a variable called name and that variable gets passed as an argument
path(<str:name>, views.greet, name="greet")

to render an entire html file instead of just a string 
def index(request):
    return render(request, "FILE_PATH", {"VAR": value})

in the html file use double curly braces to put in the value of a varible, given in django templating language

{% for i in l %}
    do something
{% endfor %}

To make a layout file for your html make a html file you are using for that layout
then inside the area you want to edit put {% blockbody %} {% endblock %}
Then when using the layout you start with {% extends "FILE_PATH" %} at the top
{% block body%}
...
{% endblock %}

Using the href to link to the url using it's name in in the urls file
<a href="{% url 'add' %}"> LINK_TEXT </a>

Steps when creating a new app
1 python3 manage.py startapp <APP_NAME>
2 go to settings.py and put <APP_NAME> in the INSTALLED_APPS list
3 in the main urls.py add the urls to the path via path('<APP_NAME>/', include("<APP_NAME>.urls"))
4 make a urls.py file in the tasks directory to store further urls for the app
urlpatterns = [ path("<path>/", views.<methodToShowView>, name=path)]
5 in views.py put your methods for displaying the pages
